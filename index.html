      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm an AI engineer and NLP researcher with a passion for building trustworthy AI systems. My work bridges academic research and practical applications, focusing on making AI more reliable, contextually aware, and grounded in real-world understanding.</p>
      
      <p>With an MSc in Computational Linguistics from the University of Stuttgart and over 2 years of AI engineering experience, I specialize in LLM applications, knowledge graph reasoning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. My research centers on a critical challenge: helping AI systems truly understand numbers in contextâ€”recognizing that 25Â°C means comfortable weather but dangerous body temperature.</p>

    <section class="research-interests">
      <h2>Research Interests</h2>
      <p>My doctoral research agenda focuses on <strong>context-sensitive numerical intelligence in AI systems</strong>. Through my master's thesis on numerical attribute prediction in knowledge graphs, I discovered that current models can perform calculations but lack numerical common sense. This insight drives my research vision:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Numerical Understanding in LLMs:</strong> Enhancing AI's ability to comprehend context-dependent numerical meanings</li>
        <li><strong>Knowledge Graph-Enhanced AI:</strong> Integrating structured knowledge to improve reasoning capabilities</li>
        <li><strong>Trustworthy AI Systems:</strong> Developing robust mechanisms against adversarial attacks and ensuring reliable outputs</li>
        <li><strong>Structured Data Processing:</strong> Enabling effective information extraction and reasoning from tabular data</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="background">
      <h2>Professional Background</h2>
      <p>I bring a unique combination of academic rigor and industry insight to AI research. My experience as an AI Software Engineer at SYSCOM Computer Engineering has given me firsthand understanding of how government and private sector organizations approach AI deployment, particularly regarding security considerations and the critical need for accurate document and data extraction.</p>
      
      <p>Having lived and worked across Taiwan, Germany, and the Netherlands, I've developed strong cross-cultural collaboration skills and a global perspective on AI applications. My multilingual background (Mandarin, English, German) and diverse teaching experienceâ€”from National Taiwan University to Leiden Universityâ€”have shaped my ability to communicate complex technical concepts across cultural contexts.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="vision">
      <h2>Research Vision</h2>
      <p>I envision AI systems that don't just process information but truly understand itâ€”systems that combine computational power with contextual awareness. My goal is to contribute to the next generation of trustworthy AI that enhances human productivity while remaining under human control, reducing hallucinations and enabling reliable real-world applications.</p>
